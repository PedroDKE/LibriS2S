f000001,18.440,20.080,"Start of chapter thirty three."
f000002,20.080,33.360,"FRIENDS and relations, and all persons living in the same house together, are apt, when life is going smoothly and peacefully with them, to make what they are doing, or what they are going to do, even more than is right or necessary, a subject of constant conversation."
f000003,33.360,42.240,"They talk to each other of their plans and their occu pations, and, without exactly taking one another's ad vice, consider and discuss together the entire progress of their lives."
f000004,42.240,63.360,"But this is far from being the case in serious moments; just when it would seem men most require the assistance and support of others, they all draw singly within themselves every one to act for him self, every one to work in his own fashion; they con ceal from one another the particular means which they employ, and only the result, the object, the thing which they realize, is again made common property."
f000005,63.360,73.240,"After so many strange and unfortunate incidents, a sort of silent seriousness had passed over the two ladies, which showed itself in a sweet mutual effort to spare each other's feelings."
f000006,73.240,76.080,"The child had been buried privately in the chapej."
f000007,76.080,80.440,"It rested there as the first offer ing to a destiny full of ominous foreshadowings."
f000008,80.440,88.040,"Elective Affinities Charlotte, as soon as ever she could, turned back to life and occupation, and here she first found Ottilie standing in need of her assistance."
f000009,88.040,92.040,"She occupied her self almost entirely with her, without letting it be ob served."
f000010,92.040,95.040,"She knew how deeply the noble girl loved Edward."
f000011,95.040,105.000,"She had discovered by degrees the scene which had preceded the accident, and had gathered every circumstance of it, partly from Ottilie herself, partly from the letters of the Major."
f000012,105.000,109.000,"Ottilie, on her side, made Charlotte's immediate life much more easy for her."
f000013,109.000,114.200,"She was open, and even talk ative, but she never spoke of the present, or of what had lately passed."
f000014,114.200,116.320,"She had been a close and thoughtful observer."
f000015,116.320,119.200,"She knew much, and now it all came to the surface."
f000016,119.200,125.680,"She entertained, she amused Charlotte, and the latter still nourished a hope in secret to see her mar ried to Edward after all."
f000017,125.680,128.640,"But something very different was passing in Ottilie."
f000018,128.640,135.840,"She had disclosed the secret of the course of her life to her friend, and she showed no more of her previous restraint and submissiveness."
f000019,135.840,141.280,"By her repentance and her resolution she felt herself freed from the burden of her fault and her misfortune."
f000020,141.280,143.960,"She had no more vio lence to do to herself."
f000021,143.960,152.560,"In the bottom of her heart she had forgiven herself solely under condition of the full est renunciation, and it was a condition which would remain binding for all time to come."
f000022,152.560,162.480,"So passed away some time, and Charlotte now felt how deeply house and park, and lake and rocks and Elective Affinities trees served to keep alive in them all their most painful reminiscences."
f000023,162.480,169.840,"They wanted change of scene, both of them, it was plain enough; but how it was to be effected was not so easy to decide."
f000024,169.840,172.160,"Were the two ladies to remain together?"
f000025,172.160,190.560,"Edward's previously expressed will appeared to enjoin it his declarations and his threats appeared to make it neces sary; only it could not be now mistaken that Charlotte and OttiliCj with all their goodwill, with all their sense, with all their efforts to conceal it, could not avoid find ing themselves in a painful situation toward one another."
f000026,190.560,194.880,"In their conversation there was a constant endeavor to avoid doubtful subjects."
f000027,194.880,203.760,"They were often obliged only half to understand some allusion; more often, expres sions were misinterpreted, if not by their understandings, at any rate by their feelings."
f000028,203.760,209.720,"They were afraid to give pain to one another, and this very fear itself pro duced the evil which they were seeking to avoid."
f000029,209.720,217.960,"If they were to try change of scene, and at the same time at any rate for a while to part, the old question came up again, where was Ottilie to go?"
f000030,217.960,226.400,"There was the grand, rich family, who still wanted a desirable companion for their daughter, their attempts to find a person whom they could trust having hitherto proved ineffectual."
f000031,226.400,234.800,"The last time the Baroness had been at the castle, she had urged Charlotte to send Ottilie there, and she had been lately pressing it again and again in her letters."
f000032,234.800,242.360,"Charlotte now a second time proposed it; but Ottilie expressly declined going anywhere, where Elective Affinities she would be thrown into what is called the great world."
f000033,242.360,252.720,"Do not think me foolish or selfwilled, my dear aunt, she said; I had better tell you what I feel, for fear you should judge hardly of me; although in any other case it would be my duty to be silent."
f000034,252.720,258.560,"A person who has fallen into uncommon misfortunes, however guiltless he may be, carries a frightful mark upon him."
f000035,258.560,263.280,"His presence, in every one who sees him and is aware of his history, excites a kind of horror."
f000036,263.280,271.240,"People see in him the terrible fate which has been laid upon him, and he is the object of a diseased and nervous curiosity."
f000037,271.240,282.000,"It is so with a house, it is so with a town, where any terrible action has been done; people enter them with awe; the light of day shines less brightly there, and the stars seem to lose their lustre."
f000038,282.000,291.800,"Perhaps we ought to excuse it, but how extreme is the indiscretion with which people behave toward such unfortunates, with their foolish importunities and awk ward kindness!"
f000039,291.800,303.120,"You must forgive me for speaking in this way, but that poor girl whom Luciana tempted out of her retirement, and with such mistaken good nature tried to force into society and amusement, has haunted me and made me miserable."
f000040,303.120,316.680,"The poor creature, when she was so frightened and tried to escape, and then sank and swooned away, and I caught her in my arms, and the party came all crowding round in terror and curiosity ! little did I think, then, that the same fate was in store for me."
f000041,316.680,327.560,"But my feeling for her is as deep and warm and fresh as ever it was; and now I may direct Elective Affinities my compassion upon myself, and secure myself from be ing the object of any similar exposure."
f000042,327.560,338.240,"But, my dear child, answered Charlotte, you will never be able to withdraw yourself where no one can see you; we have no cloisters now: otherwise, there, with your present feelings, would be your resource."
f000043,338.240,343.000,"Solitude would not give me the resource for which I wish, my dear aunt, answered Ottilie."
f000044,343.000,356.040,"The one true and valuable resource is to be looked for where we can be active and useful; all the selfdenials and all the penances on earth will fail to deliver us from an evil omened destiny, if it be determined to persecute us."
f000045,356.040,361.480,"Let me sit still in idleness and serve as a spectacle for the world, and it will overpower me and crush me."
f000046,361.480,371.840,"But find me some peaceful employment, where I can go steadily and unweariedly on doing my duty, and I shall be able to bear the eyes of men, when I need not shrink under the eyes of God."
f000047,371.840,376.640,"Unless I am much mistaken, replied Charlotte, your inclination is to return to the school."
f000048,376.640,379.360,"Yes, Ottilie answered; I do not deny it."
f000049,379.360,385.720,"I think it a happy destination to train up others in the beaten way, after having been trained in the strangest myself."
f000050,385.720,394.600,"And do we not see the same great fact in history? some moral calamity drives men out into the wilderness; but they are not allowed to remain as they had hoped in their concealment there."
f000051,394.600,404.880,"They are summoned back into the world to lead the wanderers into the right way; and who are fitter for such a service than those who have been in Elective Affinities itiated into the labyrinths of life ?"
f000052,404.880,412.680,"They are commanded to be the support of the unfortunate; and who can better fulfil that command than those who have no more mis fortunes to fear upon earth ?"
f000053,412.680,416.400,"You are selecting an uncommon profession for your self, replied Charlotte."
f000054,416.400,418.000,"I shall not oppose you, how ever."
f000055,418.000,422.560,"Let it be as you wish; only I hope it will be but for a short time."
f000056,422.560,428.000,"Most warmly I thank you, said Ottilie, for giving me leave at least to try to make the experiment."
f000057,428.000,442.200,"If I am not flattering myself too highly, I am sure I shall succeed : wherever I am I shall remember the many trials which I went through myself, and how small, how infinitely small they were compared to those which I afterward had to undergo."
f000058,442.200,451.400,"It will be my happiness to watch the embarrassments of the little creatures as they grow; to cheer them in their childish sorrows, and guide them back with a light hand out of their little aberrations."
f000059,451.400,461.960,"The fortunate is not the person to be of help to the fortunate; it is in the nature of man to require ever more and more of himself and others the more he has received."
f000060,461.960,470.720,"The unfortunate who has himself recovered knows best how to nourish, in himself and them, the feeling that every moderate good ought to be enjoyed with rapture."
f000061,470.720,477.480,"I have but one objection to make to what you pro pose' said Charlotte, after some thought, although that one seems to me of great importance."
f000062,477.480,483.960,"I am not thinking of you, but of another person : you are aware of the feel Elective Affinities ings toward you of that good, rightminded, excellent Assistant."
f000063,483.960,489.760,"In the way in which you desire to proceed, you will become every day more valuable and more in dispensable to him."
f000064,489.760,503.240,"Already he himself believes that he can never live happily without you, and hereafter, when he has become accustomed to have you to work with him, he will be unable to carry on his business if he loses you; you will have assisted him at the beginning only to injure him in the end."
f000065,503.240,511.120,"Destiny has not dealt with me with too gentle a hand, replied Ottilie; and whoever loves me has per haps not much better to expect."
f000066,511.120,534.920,"Our friend is so good and so sensible that I hope he will be able to reconcile himself to remaining in a simple relation with me; he will learn to see in me a consecrated person, lying under the shadow of an awful calamity, and only able to sup port herself and bear up against it by devoting herself to that Holy Being who is invisibly around us, and alone is able to shield us from the dark powers which threaten to overwhelm us."
f000067,534.920,554.080,"All this, which the dear girl poured out so warmly, Charlotte privately reflected over; on many different oc casions, although only in the gentlest manner, she had hinted at the possibility of Ottilie's being brought again in contact with Edward; but the slightest mention of it, the faintest hope, the least suspicion, seemed to wound Ottilie to the quick."
f000068,554.080,559.680,"One day when she could not evade it, she expressed herself to Charlotte clearly and per emptorily on the subject."
f000069,559.680,567.480,"Elective Affinities If your resolution to renounce Edward, returned Charlotte, is so firm and unalterable, then you had bet ter avoid the danger of seeing him again."
f000070,567.480,579.920,"At a distance from the object of our love, the warmer our affection, the stronger is the control which we fancy that we can exer cise on ourselves; because the whole force of the passion, diverted from its outward objects, turns inward on our selves."
f000071,579.920,589.840,"But how soon, how swiftly is our mistake made clear to us, when the thing which we thought that we could renounce, stands again before our eyes as indis pensable to us!"
f000072,589.840,593.520,"You must now do what you consider best suited to your circumstances."
f000073,593.520,597.960,"Look well into your self; change, if you prefer it, the resolution which you have just expressed."
f000074,597.960,601.760,"But do it of yourself, with a free consenting heart."
f000075,601.760,608.640,"Do not allow yourself to be drawn in by an accident; do not let yourself be surprised into your former position."
f000076,608.640,611.640,"It will place you at issue with yourself and will be intolerable to you."
f000077,611.640,624.400,"As I said, before you take this step, before you remove from me, and enter upon a new life, which will lead you no one knows in what direction, consider once more whether really, indeed, you can renounce Edward for the whole time to come."
f000078,624.400,637.520,"If you have faithfully made up your mind that you will do this, then will you enter into an engagement with me that you will never admit him into your pres ence; and if he seeks you out and forces himself upon you, that you will not exchange words with him ?"
f000079,637.520,642.600,"Ottilie did not hesitate a moment; she gave Charlotte the promise, which she had already made to herself."
f000080,642.600,650.760,"Elective Affinities Now, however, Charlotte began to be haunted with Edward's threat that he would only consent to renounce Ottilie as long as she was not parted from Charlotte."
f000081,650.760,660.720,"Since that time, indeed, circumstances were so altered, so many things had happened, that an engagement which was wrung from him in a moment of excitement might well be supposed to have been canceled."
f000082,660.720,672.760,"She was un willing, however, in the remotest sense to venture any thing or to undertake anything which might displease him, and Mittler was therefore to find Edward, and inquire what, as things now were, he wished to be done."
f000083,672.760,679.120,"Since the death of the child, Mittler had often been at the castle to see Charlotte, although only for a few moments at a time."
f000084,679.120,686.280,"The unhappy accident which had made her reconciliation with her husband in the highest degree improbable had produced a most painful effect upon him."
f000085,686.280,692.600,"But ever, as his nature was, hoping and striv ing, he rejoiced secretly at the resolution of Ottilie."
f000086,692.600,704.720,"He trusted to the softening influence of passing time; he hoped that it might still be possible to keep the husband and the wife from separating; and he tried to regard these convulsions of passion only as trials of wedded love and fidelity."
f000087,704.720,709.840,"Charlotte, at the very first, had informed the Major by letter of Ottilie's declaration."
f000088,709.840,714.640,"She had entreated him most earnestly to prevail on Edward to take no further steps for the present."
f000089,714.640,719.560,"They should keep quiet and wait, and see whether the poor girl's spirits would recover."
f000090,719.560,723.800,"She had let him know from time to time whatever was Elective Affinities necessary of what had more lately fallen from her."
f000091,723.800,730.640,"And now Mittler had to undertake the really difficult com mission of preparing Edward for an alteration in her situation."
f000092,730.640,742.720,"Mittler, however, well knowing that men can be brought more easily to submit to what is already done than to give their consent to what is yet to be done, per suaded Charlotte that it would be better to send Ottilie off at once to the school."
f000093,742.720,747.920,"Consequently as soon as Mittler was gone, prepara tions were at once made for the journey."
f000094,747.920,753.800,"Ottilie put her things together; and Charlotte observed that neither the beautiful box, nor anything out of it, was to go with her."
f000095,753.800,758.320,"Ottilie had said nothing to her on the subject; and she took no notice, but let her alone."
f000096,758.320,770.320,"The day of the departure came; Charlotte's carriage was to take Ottilie the first day as far as a place where they were well known, where she was to pass the night, and on the sec ond she would go on in it to the school."
f000097,770.320,773.720,"It was settled that Nanny was to accompany her, and remain as her attendant."
f000098,773.720,790.680,"This capricious little creature had found her way back to her mistress after the death of the child, and now hung about her as warmly and passionately as ever; indeed she seemed, with her loquacity and attentiveness, as if she wished to make good her past neglect, and hence forth devote herself entirely to Ottilie's service."
f000099,790.680,807.320,"She was quite beside herself now for joy at the thought of trav eling with her, and of seeing strange places, when she had hitherto never been away from the scene of her birth; Elective Affinities and she ran from the castle to the village to carry the news of her good fortune to her parents and her relations, and to take leave."
f000100,807.320,815.080,"Unluckily for herself, she went among other places into a room where a person was who had the measles, and caught the infection, which came out upon her at once."
f000101,815.080,817.560,"The journey could not be postponed."
f000102,817.560,819.240,"Ottilie herself was urgent to go."
f000103,819.240,822.000,"She had traveled once before the same road."
f000104,822.000,824.480,"She knew the people of the hotel where she was to sleep."
f000105,824.480,827.040,"The coachman from the castle was going with her."
f000106,827.040,828.720,"There could be nothing to fear."
f000107,828.720,831.280,"Charlotte made no opposition."
f000108,831.280,835.000,"She, too, in thought, was making haste to be clear of present embarrassments."
f000109,835.000,844.400,"The rooms which Ottilie had occupied at the castle she would have prepared for Edward as soon as possible, and restored to the old state in which they had been before the arrival of the Captain."
f000110,844.400,850.880,"The hope of bringing back old happy days burns up again and again in us, as if it never could be extinguished."
f000111,850.880,854.400,"And Charlotte was quite right; there was nothing else for her except to hope as she did."
f000112,854.400,854.880,"End of chapter"
