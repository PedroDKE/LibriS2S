f000001,15.040,16.360,"start of chapter three."
f000002,16.360,23.400,"THE Captain came, having previously written a most sensible letter, which had entirely quieted Charlotte's ap prehensions."
f000003,23.400,32.200,"So much clearness about himself, so just an understanding of his own position and the position of his friends, promised everything which was best and happiest."
f000004,32.200,40.840,"The conversation of the first few hours, as is generally the case with friends who have not met for a long time, was eager, lively, almost exhausting."
f000005,40.840,44.240,"Toward evening, Charlotte proposed a walk to the new grounds."
f000006,44.240,51.640,"The Captain was delighted with the spot, and observed every beauty which had been first brought into sight and made enjoyable by the new walks."
f000007,51.640,70.520,"He had a practised eye, and at the same time one easily satisfied; and although he knew very well what was really valuable, he never, as so many persons do, made people who were showing him things of their own uncomfortable, by requiring more than the circumstances admitted of, or by mentioning anything more perfect, which he remembered having seen elsewhere."
f000008,70.520,85.080,"When they arrived at the summerhouse, they found it dressed out for a holiday, only, indeed, with artificial Elective Affinities flowers and evergreens, but with some pretty bunches of natural cornears among them, and other field and garden fruit, so as to do credit to the taste which had arranged them."
f000009,85.080,94.240,"Although my husband does not like in general to have his birthday or christeningday kept, Charlotte said, he will not object today to these few ornaments being ex pended on a treble festival."
f000010,94.240,95.720,"Treble? cried Edward."
f000011,95.720,97.480,"Yes, indeed, she replied."
f000012,97.480,104.600,"Our friend's arrival here we are bound to keep as a festival; and have you never thought, either of you, that this is the day on which you were both christened?"
f000013,104.600,106.480,"Are you not both named Otto?"
f000014,106.480,109.080,"The two friends shook hands across the little table."
f000015,109.080,113.240,"You bring back to my mind, Edward said, this little link of our boyish affection."
f000016,113.240,122.600,"As children, we were both called so; but when we came to be at school together, it was the cause of much confusion, and I readily made over to him all my right to the pretty laconic name."
f000017,122.600,133.680,"Wherein you were not altogether so very high minded, said the Captain; for I well remember that the name of Edward had then begun to please you better, from its attractive sound when spoken by certain pretty lips."
f000018,133.680,139.480,"They were now sitting all three round the same table where Charlotte had spoken so vehemently against their guest's coming to them."
f000019,139.480,147.000,"Edward, happy as he was, did not wish to remind his wife of that time; but he could not help saying : Elective Affinities There is good room here for one more person."
f000020,147.000,150.680,"At this moment the notes of a bugle were heard across from the castle."
f000021,150.680,157.400,"Full of happy thoughts and feelings as the friends all were together, the sound fell in among them with a strong force of answering harmony."
f000022,157.400,165.120,"They listened silently, each for the moment withdrawing into himself, and feeling doubly happy in the fair circle of which he formed a part."
f000023,165.120,169.920,"The pause was first broken by Edward, who started up and walked out in front of the summerhouse."
f000024,169.920,175.560,"Our friend must not think, he said to Charlotte, that this narrow little valley forms the whole of our domain and possessions."
f000025,175.560,179.880,"Let us take him up to the top of the hill, where he can see further and breathe more freely."
f000026,179.880,185.000,"For this once, then, answered Charlotte, we must climb up the old footpath, which is not too easy."
f000027,185.000,189.240,"By the next time, I hope my walks and steps will have been car ried right up."
f000028,189.240,199.600,"And so, among rocks, and shrubs, and bushes, they made their way to the summit, where they found them v  selves, not on a level flat, but on a sloping grassy terrace, running along the ridge of the hill."
f000029,199.600,202.880,"The village, with the castle behind it, was out of sight."
f000030,202.880,219.000,"At the bottom of the valley, sheets of water were seen spreading out right and left, with wooded hills rising immediately from their opposite margin, and, at the end of the upper water, a wall of sharp, precipitous rocks directly overhanging it, their huge forms reflected in its level surface."
f000031,219.000,239.520,"In the Elective Affinities hollow of the ravine, where a considerable brook ran into the lake, lay a mill, half hidden among the trees, a sweetly retired spot, most beautifully surrounded; and through the entire semicircle over which the view ex tended, ran an endless variety of hills and valleys, copse and forest, the early green of which promised the near approach of a luxuriant clothing of foliage."
f000032,239.520,249.840,"In many places particular groups of trees caught the eye; and espe cially a cluster of planes and poplars directly at the spec tator's feet, close to the edge of the centre lake."
f000033,249.840,255.920,"They were at their full growth, and they stood there, spread ing out their boughs all around them, in fresh and lux uriant strength."
f000034,255.920,258.320,"To these Edward called his friend's attention."
f000035,258.320,261.240,"I myself planted them, he cried, when I was a boy."
f000036,261.240,268.560,"They were small trees which I rescued when my father was laying out the new part of the great castle garden, and in the middle of one summer had rooted them out."
f000037,268.560,273.280,"This year you will no doubt see them show their grati tude in a fresh set of shoots."
f000038,273.280,276.840,"They returned to the castle in high spirits, and mutu ally pleased with each other."
f000039,276.840,287.960,"To the guest was allotted an agreeable and roomy set of apartments in the right wing of the castle; and here he rapidly got his books and papers and instruments in order, to go on with his usual occupation."
f000040,287.960,291.080,"But Edward, for the first few days, gave him no rest."
f000041,291.080,306.080,"He took him about everywhere, now on foot, now on horseback, making him acquainted with the coun try and with the estate; and he embraced the opportunity Elective Affinities of imparting to him the wishes which he had been long entertaining, of getting at some better acquaintance with it, and learning to manage it more profitably."
f000042,306.080,310.360,"The first thing we have to do, said the Captain, is to make a magnetic survey of the property."
f000043,310.360,318.720,"That is a pleasant and easy matter; and if it does not admit of entire exactness, it will be always useful, and will do, at any rate, for an agreeable beginning."
f000044,318.720,323.520,"It can be made, too, without any great staff of assistants, and one can be sure of getting it completed."
f000045,323.520,329.400,"If by and by you come to require anything more exact, it will be easy then to find some plan to have it made."
f000046,329.400,332.280,"The Captain was exceedingly skilful at work of this kind."
f000047,332.280,336.720,"He had brought with him whatever instruments he required, and commenced immediately."
f000048,336.720,343.520,"Edward pro vided him with a number of foresters and peasants, who, with his instruction, were able to render him all necessary assistance."
f000049,343.520,344.880,"The weather was favorable."
f000050,344.880,351.680,"The evenings and the early mornings were devoted to the designing and drawing, and in a short time it was all filled in and col ored."
f000051,351.680,361.240,"Edward saw his possessions grow out like a new creation upon the paper; and it seemed as if now for the first time he knew what they were, as if they now first were properly his own."
f000052,361.240,374.920,"Thus there came occasion to speak of the park, and of the ways of laying it out; a far better disposition of things being made possible after a survey of this kind than could be arrived at by experimenting on nature, on partial and accidental impressions."
f000053,374.920,377.680,"Elective Affinities We must make my wife understand this, said Ed ward."
f000054,377.680,383.880,"We must do nothing of the kind, replied the Captain, who did not like bringing his own notions in collision with those of others."
f000055,383.880,393.760,"He had learned by experience that the motives and purposes by which men are influenced are far too various to be made to coalesce upon a single point, even on the most solid representations."
f000056,393.760,396.960,"We must not do it, he cried; she will be only confused."
f000057,396.960,406.320,"With her, as with all people who employ themselves on such matters merely as amateurs, the important thing is, rather that she shall do something than that something shall be done."
f000058,406.320,408.720,"Such persons feel their way with nature."
f000059,408.720,413.360,"They have fancies for this plan or that; they do not venture on removing obstacles."
f000060,413.360,415.920,"They are not bold enough to make a sacrifice."
f000061,415.920,418.520,"They do not know beforehand in what their work is to result."
f000062,418.520,433.120,"They try an experiment it succeeds it fails; they alter it; they alter, perhaps, what they ought to leave alone, and leave what they ought to alter; and so, at last, there always remains but a patchwork, which pleases and amuses, but never satisfies."
f000063,433.120,437.680,"Acknowledge candidly, said Edward, that you do not like this new work of hers."
f000064,437.680,442.400,"The idea is excellent, he replied; if the execution were equal to it, there would be no fault to find."
f000065,442.400,450.000,"But she has tormented herself to find her way up that rock; and she now torments every one, if you must have it, that she takes up after her."
f000066,450.000,454.000,"You can not walk together you can not walk behind one another with any freedom."
f000067,454.000,457.360,"Every Elective Affinities moment your step is interrupted one way or another."
f000068,457.360,459.880,"There is no end to the mistakes which she has made."
f000069,459.880,462.240,"Would it have been easy to have done it otherwise ? asked Edward."
f000070,462.240,464.280,"Perfectly, replied the Captain."
f000071,464.280,478.400,"She had only to break away a corner of the rock, which is now but an unsightly object, made up as it is of little pieces, and she would at once have a sweep for her walk and stone in abundance for the rough masonry work, to widen it in the bad places, and make it smooth."
f000072,478.400,480.800,"But this I tell you in strictest confidence."
f000073,480.800,483.240,"Her it would only confuse and an noy."
f000074,483.240,485.640,"What is done must remain as it is."
f000075,485.640,492.400,"If any more money and labor is to be spent there, there is abundance to do above the summerhouse on the hill, which we can settle our own way."
f000076,492.400,501.920,"If the two friends found in their occupation abundance of present employment, there was no lack either of enter taining reminiscences of early times, in which Charlotte took her part as well."
f000077,501.920,510.520,"They determined, moreover, that as soon as their immediate labors were finished, they would go to work upon the journal, and in this way, too, reproduce the past."
f000078,510.520,516.520,"For the rest, when Edward and Charlotte were alone, there were fewer matters of private interest between them than formerly."
f000079,516.520,522.440,"This was especially the case since the faultfinding about the grounds, which Edward thought so just, and which he felt to the quick."
f000080,522.440,538.040,"He held his tongue about what the Captain had said for a long time; but at last, when he saw his wife again preparing to go Elective Affinities to work above the summerhouse, with her paths and steps, he could not contain himself any longer, but, after a few circumlocutions, came out with his new views."
f000081,538.040,539.640,"Charlotte was thoroughly disturbed."
f000082,539.640,546.680,"She was sensible enough to perceive at once that they were right, but there was the difficulty with what was already done and what was made was made."
f000083,546.680,551.440,"She had liked it; even what was wrong had become dear to her in its details."
f000084,551.440,559.760,"She fought against her convictions; she defended her little creations; she railed at men who were forever going to the broad and the great."
f000085,559.760,568.560,"They could not let a pastime, they could not let an amusement alone, she said, but they must go and make a work out of it, never thinking of the expense which their larger plans involved."
f000086,568.560,570.640,"She was provoked, an noyed, and angry."
f000087,570.640,583.000,"Her old plans she could not give up, the new she would not quite throw from her; but, divided as she was, for the present she put a stop to the work, and gave herself time to think the thing over, and let it ripen by itself."
f000088,583.000,589.360,"At the same time that she lost this source of active amusement, the others were more and more together over their own business."
f000089,589.360,603.560,"They took to occupying themselves, moreover, with the flowergarden and the hothouses; and as they rilled up the intervals with the ordinary gentle men's amusements, hunting, riding, buying, selling, break ing horses, and such matters, she was every day left more and more to herself."
f000090,603.560,615.240,"She devoted herself more assidu ously than ever to her correspondence on account of the Captain; and yet she had many lonely hours; so that the Elective Affinities information which she now received from tKe school be came of more agreeable interest."
f000091,615.240,628.720,"To a longdrawn letter of the superior of the establish ment, filled with the usual expressions of delight at her daughter's progress, a brief postscript was attached, with a second from the hand of a gentleman in employment there as an assistant, both of which we here communicate."
f000092,628.720,636.000,"POSTSCRIPT OF THE SUPERIOR Of Ottilie, I can only repeat to your ladyship what I have already stated in my former letters."
f000093,636.000,639.560,"I do not know how to find fault with her, yet I can not say that I am satisfied."
f000094,639.560,646.720,"She is always unassuming, always ready to oblige others; but it is not pleasing to see her so timid, so almost servile."
f000095,646.720,651.120,"Your ladyship lately sent her some money, with sev eral little matters for her wardrobe."
f000096,651.120,654.800,"The money she has never touched, the dresses lay unworn in their place."
f000097,654.800,659.560,"She keeps her things very nice and very clean; but this is all she seems to care about."
f000098,659.560,663.240,"Again, I can not praise her excessive abstemiousness in eating and drinking."
f000099,663.240,670.760,"There is no extravagance at our table, but there is nothing that I like better than to see the children eat enough of good, wholesome food."
f000100,670.760,676.280,"What is carefully provided and set be fore them ought to be taken; and to this I never can succeed in bringing Ottilie."
f000101,676.280,693.960,"She is always making her self some occupation or other, always finding something which she must do, something which the servants have neglected, to escape the second course or the dessert; and Elective Affinities now it has to be considered which I can not help con necting with all this that she frequently suffers, I have lately learned, from pain in the left side of her head."
f000102,693.960,698.280,"It is only at times, but it is distressing, and may be of impor tance."
f000103,698.280,701.280,"So much upon this otherwise sweet and lovely girl."
f000104,701.280,711.240,"SECOND POSTSCRIPT, BY THE ASSISTANT Our excellent superior commonly permits me to read the letters in which she communicates her observations upon her pupils to their parents and friends."
f000105,711.240,716.760,"Such of them as are addressed to your ladyship I ever read with twofold attention and pleasure."
f000106,716.760,734.480,"We have to congratu late you upon a daughter who unites in herself every bril liant quality with which people distinguish themselves in the world; and I at least think you no less fortunate in having had bestowed upon you, in your stepdaughter, a child who has been born for the good and happiness of others, and assuredly also for her own."
f000107,734.480,740.120,"Ottilie is almost our only pupil about whom there is a difference of opinion between myself and our reverend superior."
f000108,740.120,746.680,"I do not com plain of the very natural desire in that good lady to see outward and definite fruits arising from her labors."
f000109,746.680,754.440,"But there are also fruits which are not outward, which are of the true germinal sort, and which develop themselves sooner or later in a beautiful life."
f000110,754.440,757.160,"And this I am certain is the case with your protegee."
f000111,757.160,763.840,"So long as she has been under my care, I have watched her moving with an even step, slowly, steadily forward never back."
f000112,763.840,768.960,"As with a Elective Affinities child it is necessary to begin everything at the beginning, so it is with her."
f000113,768.960,783.800,"She can comprehend nothing whicH does not follow from what precedes it; let a thing be as simple and easy as possible, she can make nothing of it if it is not in a recognizable connection; but find the inter mediate links, and make them clear to her, and then noth ing is too difficult for her."
f000114,783.800,796.800,"Progressing with such slow steps, she remains behind her companions, who, with capacities of quite a different kind, hurry on and on, learn everything readily, con nected or unconnected, recollect it with ease, and apply it with correctness."
f000115,796.800,809.960,"And again, some of the lessons here are given by excellent, but somewhat hasty and impa tient teachers, who pass from result to result, cutting short the process by which they are arrived at; and these are not of the slightest service to her; she learns nothing from them."
f000116,809.960,812.120,"There is a complaint of her handwriting."
f000117,812.120,815.800,"They say she will not, or can not, understand how to form her letters."
f000118,815.800,818.040,"I have examined closely into this."
f000119,818.040,823.360,"It is true she writes slowly, stiffly, if you like; but the hand is neither timid nor without character."
f000120,823.360,831.080,"The French language is not my department, but I have taught her something of it, in the stepbystep fashion; and this she understands easily."
f000121,831.080,838.520,"Indeed, it is singular that she knows a great deal, and knows it well, too; and yet when she is asked a ques tion, it seems as if she knew nothing."
f000122,838.520,850.040,"To conclude generally, I should say she learns noth ing like a person who is being educated, but she learns like one who is to educate not like a pupil, but like a Elective Affinities future teacher."
f000123,850.040,857.320,"Your ladyship may think it strange that I, as an educator and a teacher, can find no higher praise to give to any one than by a comparison with myself."
f000124,857.320,865.680,"I may leave it to your own good sense, to your deep knowl edge of the world and of mankind, to make the best of my most inadequate, but wellintended expressions."
f000125,865.680,870.200,"You may satisfy yourself that you have much happiness to promise yourself from this child."
f000126,870.200,879.720,"I commend myself to your ladyship, and I beseech you to permit me to write to you again as soon as I see reason to believe that I have anything important or agreeable to communicate."
f000127,879.720,881.880,"This letter gave Charlotte great pleasure."
f000128,881.880,887.880,"The con tents of it coincided very closely with the notions which she had herself conceived of Ottilie."
f000129,887.880,895.760,"At the same time, she could not help smiling at the excessive interest of the assistant, which seemed greater than the insight into a pupil's excellence usually calls forth."
f000130,895.760,915.200,"In her quiet, un prejudiced way of looking at things, this relation, among others, she was contented to permit to lie before her as a possibility; she could value the interest of so sensible a man in Ottilie, having learned, among the lessons of her life, to see how highly true regard is to be prized, in a world where indifference or dislike are the common natural residents."
f000131,915.200,915.240,"end of chapter."
