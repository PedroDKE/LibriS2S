f000002,19.240,32.400,"Edward so we shall call a wealthy nobleman in the prime of life had been spending several hours of a fine April morning in his nurserygarden, budding the stems of some young trees with cuttings which had been re cently sent to him."
f000003,32.400,42.600,"He had finished what he was about, and having laid his tools together in their box, was com placently surveying his work, when the gardener came up and complimented his master on his industry."
f000004,42.600,46.880,"Have you seen my wife anywhere? inquired Ed ward, as he moved to go away."
f000005,46.880,56.840,"My lady is alone yonder in the new grounds said the man; the summerhouse which she has been making on the rock over against the castle is finished today, and really it is beautiful."
f000006,56.840,59.240,"It can not fail to please your grace."
f000007,59.240,70.240,"The view from it is perfect the village at your feet; a little to your right the church, with its tower, which you can just see over; and directly opposite you, the castle and the garden."
f000008,70.240,75.560,"Quite true, replied Edward; I can see the people at work a few steps from where I am standing."
f000009,75.560,85.000,"And then, to the right of the church again, con tinued the gardener, is the opening of the valley; and II Elective Affinities you look along over a range of wood and meadow far into the distance."
f000010,85.000,88.040,"The steps up the rock, too, are excel lently arranged."
f000011,88.040,93.000,"My gracious lady understands these things; it is a pleasure to work under her."
f000012,93.000,96.960,"Go to her, said Edward, and desire her to be so good as to wait for me there."
f000013,96.960,101.440,"Tell her I wish to see this new creation of hers, and enjoy it with her."
f000014,101.440,105.360,"The gardener went rapidly off, and Edward soon fol lowed."
f000015,105.360,118.760,"Descending the terrace, and stopping as he passed to look into the hothouses and the forcingpits, he came presently to the stream, and thence, over a narrow bridge, to a place where the walk leading to the summerhouse branched off in two directions."
f000016,118.760,123.160,"One path led across the churchyard, immediately up the face of the rock."
f000017,123.160,129.240,"The other, into which he struck, wound away to the left, with a more gradual ascent, through a pretty shrubbery."
f000018,129.240,147.240,"Where the two paths joined again, a seat had been made, where he stopped a few moments to rest; and then, fol lowing the now single road, he found himself, after scrambling along among steps and slopes of all sorts and kinds, conducted at last through a narrow, more or less steep outlet to the summerhouse."
f000019,147.240,150.240,"Charlotte was standing at the door to receive her hus band."
f000020,150.240,159.800,"She made him sit down where, without moving, he could command a view of the different landscapes through the door and window these serving as frames, in which they were set like pictures."
f000021,159.800,167.080,"Spring was coming on; a rich, beautiful life would soon everywhere be burst ing; and Edward spoke of it with delight."
f000022,167.080,172.520,"Elective Affinities There is only one thing which I should observe, he added, the summerhouse itself is rather small."
f000023,172.520,176.120,"It is large enough for you and me, at any rate, an swered Charlotte."
f000024,176.120,180.200,"Certainly, said Edward; there is room for a third, too, easily."
f000025,180.200,183.800,"Of course; and for a fourth also, replied Charlotte."
f000026,183.800,187.040,"For larger parties we can contrive other places."
f000027,187.040,202.160,"Now that we are here by ourselves, with no one to disturb us, and in such a pleasant mood, said Edward, it is a good opportunity for me to tell you that I have for some time had something on my mind, about which I have wished to speak to you, but have never been able to muster up my courage."
f000028,202.160,205.640,"I have observed that there has been something, of the sort, said Charlotte."
f000029,205.640,217.160,"And even now, Edward went on, if it were not for a letter which the post brought me this morning, and which obliges me to come to some resolution today, I should very likely have still kept it to myself."
f000030,217.160,221.200,"What is it, then? asked Charlotte, turning affec tionately toward him."
f000031,221.200,228.240,"It concerns our friend the Captain, answered Ed ward; you know the unfortunate position in which he, like many others, is placed."
f000032,228.240,238.800,"It is through no fault of his own; but you may imagine how painful it must be for a person with his knowledge and talents and accomplish ments, to find himself without employment."
f000033,238.800,242.400,"I I will not hesitate any longer with what I am wishing for Elective Affinities him."
f000034,242.400,245.200,"I should like to have him here with' us for a time."
f000035,245.200,250.400,"We must think about that, replied Charlotte; it should be considered on more sides than one."
f000036,250.400,253.720,"I am quite ready to tell you what I have in view, returned Edward."
f000037,253.720,259.400,"Through his last letters there is a prevailing tone of despondency; not that he is really in any want."
f000038,259.400,265.640,"He knows thoroughly well how to limit his expenses; and I have taken care for everything abso lutely necessary."
f000039,265.640,278.000,"It is no distress to him to accept obli gations from me; all our lives we have been in the habit of borrowing from and lending to each other; and we could not tell, if we would, how our debtor and creditor account stands."
f000040,278.000,281.200,"It is being without occupation which is really fretting him."
f000041,281.200,291.440,"The many accomplishments which he has cultivated in himself, it is his only pleasure in deed, it is his passion to be daily and hourly exercising for the benefit of others."
f000042,291.440,306.080,"And now, to sit still, with his arms folded; or to go on studying, acquiring, and ac quiring, when he can make no use of what he already possesses; my dear creature, it is a painful situation; and alone as he is, he feels it doubly and trebly."
f000043,306.080,309.840,"But I thought, said Charlotte, that he had had offers from many different quarters."
f000044,309.840,317.800,"I myself wrote to numbers of my own friends, male and female, for him; and, as I have reason to believe, not without effect."
f000045,317.800,328.360,"It is true, replied Edward; but these very offers these various proposals have only caused him fresh em barrassment Not one of them is at all suitable to such a Elective Affinities person as he is."
f000046,328.360,337.040,"He would have nothing to do; he would have to sacrifice himself, his time, his purpose, his whole method of life; and to that he can not bring himself."
f000047,337.040,342.760,"The more I think of it all, the more I feel about it, and the more anxious I am to see him here with us."
f000048,342.760,353.160,"It is very beautiful and amiable in you, answered Charlotte, to enter with so much sympathy into your friend's position; only you must allow me to ask you to think of yourself and of me, as well."
f000049,353.160,355.160,"I have done that, replied Edward."
f000050,355.160,360.760,"For ourselves, we can have nothing to expect from his presence with us, except pleasure and advantage."
f000051,360.760,362.880,"I will say nothing of the expense."
f000052,362.880,369.680,"In any case, if he came to us, it would be but small; and you know he will be of no inconvenience to us at all."
f000053,369.680,375.840,"He can have his own rooms in the right wing of the castle, and everything else can be arranged as simply as possible."
f000054,375.840,382.160,"What shall we not be thus doing for him! and how agreeable and how profitable may not his society prove to us!"
f000055,382.160,385.360,"I have long been wishing for a plan of the property and the grounds."
f000056,385.360,386.960,"He will see to it, and get it made."
f000057,386.960,395.760,"You intend yourself to take the management of the estate, as soon as our present stew ard's term is expired; and that, you know, is a serious thing."
f000058,395.760,402.280,"His various information will be of immense benefit to us; I feel only too acutely how much I require a per son of this kind."
f000059,402.280,408.080,"The country people have knowledge enough, but their way of imparting it is confused, and not always honest."
f000060,408.080,415.440,"The students from the towns and univer sities are sufficiently clever and orderly, but they are de Elective Affinities ficient in personal experience."
f000061,415.440,427.960,"From my friend, I can promise myself both knowledge and method, and hun dreds of other circumstances I can easily conceive aris ing, affecting you as well as me, and from which I can foresee innumerable advantages."
f000062,427.960,431.080,"Thank you for so pa tiently listening to me."
f000063,431.080,436.440,"Now, do you say what you think, and say it out freely and fully; I will not interrupt you."
f000064,436.440,441.760,"Very well, replied Charlotte; I will begin at once with a general observation."
f000065,441.760,447.600,"Men think most of the im mediate the present; and rightly, their calling being to do and to work."
f000066,447.600,461.320,"Women, on the other hand, more of how things hang together in life; and that rightly too, because their destiny the destiny of their families is bound up in this interdependence, and it is exactly this which it is their mission to promote."
f000067,461.320,473.000,"So now let us cast a glance at our present and our past life; and you will acknowledge that the invitation of the Captain does not fall in so entirely with our purposes, our plans, and our arrangements."
f000068,473.000,475.960,"I will go back to those happy days of pur earliest intercourse."
f000069,475.960,480.240,"We loved each other, young as we then were, with all our hearts."
f000070,480.240,495.160,"We were parted: you from me your father, from an insatiable desire of wealth, choosing to marry you to an elderly and rich lady; I from you, having to give my hand, without any espe cial motive, to an excellent man, whom I respected, if I did not love."
f000071,495.160,504.800,"We became again free you first, your poor mother at the same time leaving you in possession of your large fortune; I later, just at the time when you returned from abroad."
f000072,504.800,506.880,"So we met once more."
f000073,506.880,515.160,"We spoke of the Elective Affinities past; we could enjoy and love the recollection of it; we might have been contented, in each other's society, to leave things as they were."
f000074,515.160,516.920,"You were urgent for our mar riage."
f000075,516.920,518.720,"I at first hesitated."
f000076,518.720,523.440,"We were about the same age; but I as a woman had grown older than you as a man."
f000077,523.440,528.000,"At last I could not refuse you what you seemed to think the one thing you cared for."
f000078,528.000,539.080,"All the discomfort which you had ever experienced, at court, in the army, or in travel ing, you were to recover from at my side; you would set tle down and enjoy life; but only with me for your com panion."
f000079,539.080,552.840,"I settled my daughter at a school, where she could be more completely educated than would be possible in the retirement of the country; and I placed my niece Ottilie there with her as well, who, perhaps, would have grown up better at home with me, under my own care."
f000080,552.840,564.240,"This was done with your consent, merely that we might have our own lives to ourselves merely that we might enjoy undisturbed our solongwishedfor, solongdelayed happiness."
f000081,564.240,566.480,"We came here and settled ourselves."
f000082,566.480,571.240,"I un dertook the domestic part of the menage, you the outof doors, and the general control."
f000083,571.240,576.360,"My own principle has been to meet your wishes in everything, to live only for you."
f000084,576.360,582.000,"At least, let us give ourselves a fair trial how far in this way we can be enough for one another."
f000085,582.000,598.000,"Since the interdependence of things, as you call it, is your especial element, replied Edward, one should either never listen to any of your trains of reasoning, or make up one's mind to allow you to be in the right; and, indeed, you have been in the right up to the present day."
f000086,598.000,607.640,"Elective Affinities The foundation which we have hitherto been laying for ourselves is of the true, sound sort; only, are we to build nothing upon it? is nothing to be developed out of it?"
f000087,607.640,613.560,"All the work we have done I in the garden, you in the park is it all only for a pair of hermits?"
f000088,613.560,615.560,"Well, well, replied Charlotte, very well."
f000089,615.560,622.440,"What we have to look to is, that we introduce no alien element, nothing which shall cross or obstruct us."
f000090,622.440,628.920,"Remember, our plans, even those which only concern our amusements, de pend mainly on our being together."
f000091,628.920,633.840,"You were to read to me, in consecutive order, the journal which you made when you were abroad."
f000092,633.840,649.560,"You were to take the opportu nity of arranging it, putting all the loose matter con nected with it in its place; and with me to work with you and help you, out of these invaluable but chaotic leaves and sheets to put together a complete thing, which should give the pleasure to ourselves and to others."
f000093,649.560,660.520,"I prom ised to assist you in transcribing; and we thought it would be so pleasant, so delightful, so charming, to travel over in recollection the world which we were unable to see together."
f000094,660.520,662.680,"The beginning is already made."
f000095,662.680,671.480,"Then, in the evenings, you have taken up your flute again, accompany ing me on the piano, while of visits backward and for ward among the neighborhood, there is abundance."
f000096,671.480,678.800,"For my part, I have been promising myself out of all this the first really happy summer I have ever thought to spend in my life."
f000097,678.800,692.680,"Only I can not see, replied Edward, rubbing his fore head, how, through every bit of this which you have Elective Affinities been so sweetly and so sensibly laying before me, the Captain's presence can be any interruption; I should rather have thought it would give it all f.esh zest and life."
f000098,692.680,695.560,"He was my companion during a part of my travels."
f000099,695.560,698.800,"He made many observations from a different point of view from mine."
f000100,698.800,703.000,"We can put it all together, and so make a charmingly complete work of it."
f000101,703.000,709.560,"Well, then, I will acknowledge openly, answered Charlotte, with some impatience, my fueling is against this plan."
f000102,709.560,712.280,"I have an instinct which tells me no good will come of it."
f000103,712.280,715.480,"You women are invincible in this way, replied Ed ward."
f000104,715.480,727.000,"You are so sensible that there is no answering you, then so affectionate that one is glad to give way to you; full of feelings, which one can not wound, and full of forebodings, which terrify one."
f000105,727.000,741.120,"I am not superstitious, said Charlotte; and I care nothing for these dim sensations, merely as such; but in general they are the result of unconscious recollections pf happy or unhappy consequences, which we have expe rienced as following on our own or others' actions."
f000106,741.120,746.480,"Nothing is of greater moment, in any state of things, than the intervention of a third person."
f000107,746.480,760.240,"I have seen friends, brothers and sisters, lovers, husbands and wives, whose relation to each other, through the accidental or intentional introduction of a third person, has been alto gether changed whose whole moral condition has been inverted by it."
f000108,760.240,776.480,"That may very well be, replied Edward, with peo Elective Affinities pie who live on without looking where they are going; but not, surely, with persons whom experience has taught to understand themselves. j di ii  mi i ii.   That understanding ourselves, my dearest husband, insisted Charlotte, is no such certain weapon."
f000109,776.480,779.440,"It is very often a most dangerous one for the person who bears it."
f000110,779.440,785.400,"And out of all this, at least so much seems to arise, that we should not be in too great a hurry."
f000111,785.400,788.880,"Let me have a few days to think; don't decide."
f000112,788.880,795.840,"As the matter stands, returned Edward, wait as many days as we will, we shall still be in too great a hurry."
f000113,795.840,804.160,"The arguments for and against are all before us; all we want is the conclusion, and as things are, I think the best thing we can do is to draw lots."
f000114,804.160,809.120,"I know, said Charlotte, that in doubtful cases it is your way to leave' them to chance."
f000115,809.120,813.520,"To me, in such a serious matter, this seems almost a crime."
f000116,813.520,818.280,"Then what am I to write to the Captain ? cried Ed ward; for write I must at once."
f000117,818.280,822.600,"Write him a kind, sensible, sympathizing letter, an swered Charlotte."
f000118,822.600,825.920,"That is as good as none at all, replied Edward."
f000119,825.920,832.760,"And there are many cases, answered she, in which we are obliged, and in which it is the real kindness, rather to write nothing than not to write."
f000120,832.760,833.600,"end of chapter."
