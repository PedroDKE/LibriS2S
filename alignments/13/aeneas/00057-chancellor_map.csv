f000006,51.680,53.240,"We had not long to wait."
f000007,53.240,61.200,"Before an hour had passed Curtis, leaped in ecstasy and raised the joyous shout of Land ahoy!"
f000008,61.200,63.480,"My journal has come to a close."
f000009,63.480,68.960,"I have only to relate, as briefly as possible, the circumstances that finally brought us to our destination."
f000010,68.960,82.320,"A few hours after we first sighted land the raft was off Cape Magoari, on the Island of Marajo, and was observed by some fishermen who, with kindhearted alacrity picked us up, and tended us most carefully."
f000011,82.320,90.800,"They conveyed us to Para, where we became the objects of unbounded sympathy."
f000012,90.800,98.320,"deg. min. N., so that since we abandoned the Chancellor we had drifted at least fifteen degrees to the southwest."
f000013,98.320,108.000,"Except for the influence of the Gulf Stream we must have been carried far, far to the south, and in that case we should never have reached the mouth of the Amazon, and must inevitably have been lost."
f000014,108.000,116.640,"Of the thirtytwo soulsnine passengers, and twentythree seamenwho left Charleston on board the ship, only five passengers and six seamen remain."

f000020,154.800,190.960,"After all the dangers and privations which we have undergone together, it is scarcely necessary to say that there has arisen between the surviving passengers of the Chancellor a bond of friendship too indissoluble, I believe, for either time or circumstance to destroy; Curtis must ever remain the honoured and valued friend of those whose welfare he consulted so faithfully in their misfortunes; his conduct was beyond all praise When we were fairly on our homeward way, Miss Herbey by chance intimated to us her intention of retiring from the world and devoting the remainder of her life to the care of the sick and suffering."
f000021,190.960,199.400,"Then why not come and look after my son? said M. Letourneur, adding, he is an invalid, and be requires, as he deserves, the best of nursing."

f000023,206.920,218.880,"A brother, I say; but may we not hope that she may be united by a dearer and a closer tie, and that the noblehearted girl may experience the happiness that so richly she deserves?"
