f000078,467.840,473.640,"We will be on board at nine o'clock, replied, no less simply, Mr. Fogg."

f000080,474.760,498.240,"To disembark from the  Hen rietta, jump into a hack, hurry to the St. Nicholas, and return with Aouda, Passepartout, and even the inseparable Fix, was the work of a brief time, and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him."

f000082,504.040,516.840,"When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost, he uttered a prolonged Oh ! which extended throughout his vocal gamut."
