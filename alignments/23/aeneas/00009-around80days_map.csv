f000003,44.760,58.200,"The Mongolia, thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time."
f000004,58.200,77.840,"The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India — some for Bombay, others for Cal cutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula."

f000006,115.520,129.840,"What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the Mongolia."
f000007,129.840,154.800,"The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the eight o'clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whiled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games."
f000008,154.800,164.120,"But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs."
f000009,164.120,173.960,"When the wind came from the African or Asian coast, the Mongolia, with her long hull, rolled fearfully."
f000010,173.960,182.480,"Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased."

f000013,197.200,216.160,"It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows— every chance, in short, which might force the  Mongolia  to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey."
f000014,216.160,223.960,"But if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign."

f000017,281.240,287.240,"How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia ?"
f000018,287.240,304.960,"He made his four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself."

f000056,494.960,512.640,"He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer barroom, which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows."

f000063,564.800,578.840,"This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal mines; it costs the Peninsula Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year."

f000072,679.440,688.000,"At six p.m. the  Mongolia  slowly moved out of the roadstead, and was soon once more on the Indian Ocean."
