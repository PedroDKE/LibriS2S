f000003,42.440,58.800,"Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow's hand, and his master said,  Well done ! which, from him, was high com mendation; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg."
f000004,58.800,78.240,"As for him, he had only been struck with a  queer  idea; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he, Passepartout, the ex gymnast, exsergeant fireman, had been the spouse of a charming woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah !"
f000005,78.240,91.800,"As for the young Indian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing, and now, wrapped up in a travellingblanket, was reposing in one of the howdahs."

f000009,116.920,124.720,"The guide made her drink a little brandy and water, but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off."
f000010,124.720,136.000,"Sir Francis, who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on her account."
f000011,136.000,141.000,"But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate."
f000012,141.000,151.360,"He told Phileas Fogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners."
f000013,151.360,163.920,"These fanatics were scattered throughout the country, and would, despite the English police, recover their victim at Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta."
f000014,163.920,168.560,"She would only be safe by quitting India for ever."
f000015,168.560,173.440,"Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter."
f000016,173.440,187.640,"The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock, and the interrupted line of railway being resumed, would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twentyfour hours."
f000017,187.640,198.320,"Phileas Fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day, October th, at noon, for Hong Kong."

f000019,216.400,241.720,"Passepartout started off forthwith, and found himself in the streets of Allahabad, that is, the  City of God, one of the most venerated in India, being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers Ganges and Jumna, the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula."
f000020,241.720,251.600,"The Ganges, according to the legends of the Ramayana, rises in heaven, whence, owing to Brahma's agency, it descends to the earth."
f000021,251.600,258.760,"Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to take a good look at the city."
f000022,258.760,279.680,"It was formerly defended by a noble fort, which has since become a state prison; its commerce has dwindled away, and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street."
f000023,279.680,300.240,"At last he came upon an elderly, crusty Jew, who sold secondhand articles, and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff, a large mantle, and a fine otterskin pelisse, for which he did not hesitate to pay seventyfive pounds."
f000024,300.240,303.280,"He then returned triumphantly to the station."
f000025,303.280,318.440,"The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield, and she became more herself, so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression."

f000027,339.240,362.600,"Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of Hima laya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes."
f000028,362.600,374.680,"Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passionflower's halfenveloped breast."
f000029,374.680,396.120,"Her delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotusbud, glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda."

f000031,429.920,442.520,"It is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhap sody to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation of the phrase."

f000057,590.720,613.240,"Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor, and then Sir Francis nar rated to her what had passed, dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her, and recounting the happy sequel of the ven ture, the result of Passepartout's rash idea."
f000058,613.240,622.520,"Mr. Fogg said nothing; while Passepartout, abashed, kept repeating that  it wasn't worth telling."
f000059,622.520,633.600,"Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips."
f000060,633.600,644.560,"Then, as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice, and recalled the dangers which still menaced her, she shuddered with terror."
f000061,644.560,663.680,"Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda's mind, and offered, in order to reassure her, to escort her to Hong Kong, where she might remain safely until the affair AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS. was hushed up— an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted."

f000065,708.480,719.880,"Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts, giving an aspect of desolation to the place, as the train entered it."
f000066,719.880,729.760,"Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty's destination, the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles north ward of the city."

f000072,788.920,806.880,"Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups of Indians, despite the ad vanced season and chilly air, were performing solemnly their pious ablutions."
f000073,806.880,829.880,"These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, their deities being Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators."
f000074,829.880,854.240,"What would these divinities think of India, anglicized as it is today, with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls which float upon its sur face, the turtles swarming along its banks, and the faithful dwelling upon its borders ?"
f000075,854.240,920.920,"The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles southwestward from Benares, the ancient stron ghold of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur and its famous rosewater factories; or the tomb of Lord Corn wallis, rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar, or Patna, a large manufacturing and trading place, where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir, a more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester or Birmingham, with its iron AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS. foundries, edgetool factories, and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward."
f000076,920.920,954.720,"Night came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda, ruined Gour, Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country's flag flying, were hidden from their view in the darkness."
f000077,954.720,967.520,"Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him."
