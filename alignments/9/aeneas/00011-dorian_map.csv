f000001,13.320,19.960,"CHAPTER XI FOR years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book."
f000002,19.960,25.400,"Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free him self from it."
f000003,25.400,43.440,"He procured from Paris no less than nine largepaper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control."
f000004,43.440,55.520,"The hero, the wonderful young Parisian, in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself."
f000005,55.520,63.600,"And, in deed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life, written before he had lived it."
f000006,63.600,68.280,"In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero."
f000007,68.280,88.200,"He never knew never, indeed, had any cause to know that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water, which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beauty that had once, apparently, been so re markable."
f000008,88.200,112.920,"It was with an almost cruel joy and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every plea sure, cruelty has its place that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if some what overemphasised, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and in the world, he had most dearly valued."
f000009,112.920,121.520,"For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him."
f000010,121.520,135.720,"Even those who had heard the most evil things against him, and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs, could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him."
f000011,135.720,141.520,"He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world."
f000012,141.520,146.960,"Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room."
f000013,146.960,151.240,"There was something in the purity of his face that re buked them."
f000014,151.240,157.880,"His mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished."
f000015,157.880,168.320,"They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual."
f000016,168.320,200.800,"Often, on returning home from one of those mys terious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and ageing face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass."
f000017,200.800,206.320,"The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure."
f000018,206.320,213.320,"He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul."
f000019,213.320,232.240,"He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead, or crawled around the heavy sen sual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age."
f000020,232.240,238.920,"He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile."
f000021,238.920,243.960,"He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs."
f000022,243.960,269.320,"There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicatelyscented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little illfamed tavern near the Docks, which, under an assumed name, and was purely selfish."
f000023,269.320,272.320,"But moments such as these were rare."
f000024,272.320,283.120,"That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratifi cation."
f000025,283.120,287.160,"The more he knew, the more he desired to know."
f000026,287.160,292.120,"He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them."
f000027,292.120,297.680,"Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society."
f000028,297.680,312.880,"Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most cele brated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art."
f000029,312.880,335.200,"His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and plac ing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle sym phonic arrangements of exotic flow r ers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver."
f000030,335.200,358.120,"Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realisation of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world."
f000031,358.120,369.040,"To them he seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to  make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty."
f000032,369.040,375.840,"Like Gautier, he was one for whom  the visible world existed."
f000033,375.840,387.600,"And, certainly, to him Life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation."
f000034,387.600,424.920,"Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment uni versal, and Dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only halfserious, fopperies."
f000035,424.920,457.920,"For, while he was but too ready to accept the posi tion that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the  Satyricon  once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane."
f000036,457.920,472.160,"He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosopy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualising of the senses its highest realisation."
f000037,472.160,490.200,"The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organised forms of existence."
f000038,490.200,516.320,"But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic."
f000039,516.320,522.600,"As he looked back upon man moving through History, he was haunted by a feeling of loss."
f000040,522.600,576.520,"So much had been surrendered ! and to such little purpose There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self torture and selfdenial, whose origin was fear, and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from w r hich, in their Ignorance, they had sought to escape, Nature, in her Yes : there was to be, as Lord Henry had pro phesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life, and to save it from that harsh, uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival."
f000041,576.520,588.320,"It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly; yet, it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience."
f000042,588.320,598.040,"Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be."
f000043,598.040,607.360,"Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing."
f000044,607.360,615.680,"But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment."
f000045,615.680,651.200,"There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dream less nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and in stinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie."
f000046,651.200,657.640,"Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble."
f000047,657.640,664.840,"In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room, and crouch there."
f000048,664.840,685.560,"Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills, and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers, and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave."
f000049,685.560,699.760,"Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of tilings are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern."
f000050,699.760,720.000,"The wan or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often."
f000051,720.000,723.280,"Nothing seems to us changed."
f000052,723.280,729.640,"Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known."
f000053,729.640,776.680,"We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the memories of pleasure their pain."
f000054,776.680,822.960,"It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delight ful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not imcompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it."
f000055,822.960,832.560,"It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion; and cer tainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him."
f000056,832.560,842.160,"The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as sought to symbolise."
f000057,842.160,882.360,"He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement, and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered vestment, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled lanternshaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the  perm's cselestis, the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice, and smiting his breast for his sins."
f000058,882.360,893.200,"The fuming censers, that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers, had their subtle fascina tion for him."
f000059,893.200,907.840,"As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals, and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives."
f000060,907.840,928.840,"But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the so journ of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail."
f000061,928.840,969.200,"Mys ticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the material istic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement In Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased."
f000062,969.200,978.400,"Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself."
f000063,978.400,1004.880,"He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual specula And so he would now study perfumes, and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavilyscented oils, and burning odorous gums from the East."
f000064,1004.880,1056.160,"He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and In ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweetsmelling roots, and scented pollenladen flowers, or aromatic balms, and of dark and fragrant woods, of spikenard that sickens, of hovenia that makes men mad, and of aloes that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul."
f000065,1056.160,1098.440,"At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilionandgold ceiling and walls of olivegreen lacquer, he used to give curious concerts, in which mad gypsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave yellowshawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of mon strous lutes, while grinning negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums, and, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass, and charmed, or feigned to charm, great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders."
f000066,1098.440,1113.800,"The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his ear."
f000067,1113.800,1132.720,"He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilisations, and loved to touch and try them."
f000068,1132.720,1163.440,"He fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chili, and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness."
f000069,1163.440,1220.080,"He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long clarin of the Mexi cans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh lure of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the teponaztli, that has two vibrating tongues of wood, and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum ob tained from the milky juice of plants; the yoZbells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description."
f000070,1220.080,1235.200,"The fantastic character of these In struments fascinated him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that Art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices."
f000071,1235.200,1254.600,"Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the Opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to  Tannhauser, and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul."
f000072,1254.600,1267.080,"On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hun dred and sixty pearls."
f000073,1267.080,1274.400,"This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him."
f000074,1274.400,1308.320,"He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the olivegreen chrysoberyl that fiery scarlet with tremulous fourrayed stars, flame red cinnamonstones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire."
f000075,1308.320,1317.000,"He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal."
f000076,1317.000,1331.520,"He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs."
f000077,1331.520,1335.280,"He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels."
f000078,1335.280,1352.960,"In Alphonso's  Clericalis Disciplina  a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in the ro mantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes  with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs."
f000079,1352.960,1366.440,"There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philos tratus told us, and  by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe  the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep, and slain."
f000080,1366.440,1374.960,"According to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the dia mond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent."
f000081,1374.960,1384.400,"The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine."
f000082,1384.400,1391.280,"The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour."
f000083,1391.280,1401.200,"The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids."

f000103,1621.200,1636.800,"As he investigated the subject and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up he was al most saddened by the reflection of the ruin that Time brought on beautiful and wonderful things."

f000119,1889.200,1914.160,"In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for, and wounded by selfinflicted pain."
f000120,1914.160,1930.000,"He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and goldthread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pineapple device wrought in seedpearls."
f000121,1930.000,1939.640,"The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood."
f000122,1939.640,1944.480,"This was Italian work of the fifteenth century."
f000123,1944.480,1958.320,"Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heartshaped groups of acanthusleaves, from which spread longstemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals."
f000124,1958.320,1963.360,"The morse bore a seraph's head in gold thread raised work."
f000125,1963.360,1973.840,"The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian."

f000128,2033.200,2052.800,"Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the purpleandgold pall as a curtain."
f000129,2052.800,2065.680,"For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart, his wonder ful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence."
f000130,2065.680,2079.240,"Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away."
f000131,2079.240,2101.000,"On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of indivi dualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure, at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own."
f000132,2101.000,2115.520,"After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walledin house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter."
f000133,2115.520,2131.000,"He hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his absence someone might gain access to the room, in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door."
f000134,2131.000,2135.120,"He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing."
f000135,2135.120,2146.560,"It was true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn from that ?"
f000136,2146.560,2149.600,"He would laugh at anyone who tried to taunt him."
f000137,2149.600,2151.480,"He had not painted it."
f000138,2151.480,2155.320,"What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked ?"
f000139,2155.320,2185.120,"Even if he told them, would they believe it ? who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with, and that the picture was still there."
f000140,2185.120,2186.880,"What if it should be stolen ?"
f000141,2186.880,2190.320,"The mere thought made him cold with horror."
f000142,2190.320,2194.640,"Surely the world would know his secret then."
f000143,2194.640,2197.760,"Perhaps the world already suspected it."
f000144,2197.760,2203.440,"For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him."
f000145,2203.440,2222.680,"He was very nearly black balled at a West End club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was said that on one occasion when he was brought by a friend into the smokingroom of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out."
f000146,2222.680,2229.200,"Curious stories became current about him after he had passed his twentyfifth year."
f000147,2229.200,2242.120,"It was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he con sorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade."
f000148,2242.120,2260.360,"His extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though they were determined to discover his secret."
f000149,2260.360,2288.640,"Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in them selves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about him."
f000150,2288.640,2307.600,"It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room."
f000151,2307.600,2316.120,"Yet these whispered scandals only increased, in the eyes of many, his strange and dangerous charm."
f000152,2316.120,2320.040,"His great wealth was a certain element of security."
f000153,2320.040,2330.280,"Society, civilised society at least, is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating."
f000154,2330.280,2342.760,"It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef."
f000155,2342.760,2354.560,"And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life."
f000156,2354.560,2366.560,"Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for halfcold entrees, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject; and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view."
f000157,2366.560,2373.120,"For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art."
f000158,2373.120,2376.320,"Form is absolutely es sential to it."
f000159,2376.320,2389.160,"It should have the dignity of a cere mony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us."
f000160,2389.160,2393.840,"Is insincerity such a terrible thing ?"
f000161,2393.840,2395.680,"I think not."
f000162,2395.680,2400.360,"It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities."
f000163,2400.360,2405.240,"Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion."
f000164,2405.240,2415.400,"He used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the Ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence."
f000165,2415.400,2432.800,"To him, man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sen sations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead."
f000166,2432.800,2451.840,"He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picturegallery of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins."
f000167,2451.840,2457.000,"Here was Philip Herbert, de face, which kept him not long company."
f000168,2457.000,2462.160,"Was it young Herbert's life that he sometimes led?"
f000169,2462.160,2468.800,"Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own ?"
f000170,2468.800,2482.720,"Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hall ward's studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his life ?"
f000171,2482.720,2496.680,"Here, in goldembroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and giltedged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silverandblack armour piled at his feet."
f000172,2496.680,2499.560,"What had this man's legacy been ?"
f000173,2499.560,2505.480,"Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples be queathed him some inheritance of sjn and shame ?"
f000174,2505.480,2511.280,"Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realise ?"
f000175,2511.280,2521.480,"Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, In her gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves."
f000176,2521.480,2529.200,"A flower was in her right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses."
f000177,2529.200,2534.440,"On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple."
f000178,2534.440,2539.200,"There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes."
f000179,2539.200,2544.120,"He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told about her lovers."
f000180,2544.120,2548.120,"Had he something of her temperament in him ?"
f000181,2548.120,2553.680,"These oval heavylidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him."
f000182,2553.680,2558.960,"What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches ?"
f000183,2558.960,2568.400,"How evil he looked I The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain."
f000184,2568.400,2575.120,"Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings."
f000185,2575.120,2581.720,"He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars."
f000186,2581.720,2591.920,"What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert ?"
f000187,2591.920,2607.840,"How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose ! upon his breast."
f000188,2607.840,2616.920,"Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thinlipped woman in black."
f000189,2616.920,2619.760,"Her blood, also, stirred within him."
f000190,2619.760,2631.960,"How curious it all seemed And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face, and her moist winedashed lips he knew what he had got from her."
f000191,2631.960,2636.720,"He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others."
f000192,2636.720,2640.680,"She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress."
f000193,2640.680,2643.560,"There were vine leaves in her hair."
f000194,2643.560,2646.360,"The purple spilled from the cup she was holding."
f000195,2646.360,2653.800,"The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour."
f000196,2653.800,2657.160,"They seemed to follow him wherever he went."
f000197,2657.160,2671.760,"Yet one had ancestors in literature, as well as in one's own race, nearer perhaps in type and tempera ment, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious."
f000198,2671.760,2689.600,"There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions."
f000199,2689.600,2701.960,"He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous, and evil so full of subtlety."
f000200,2701.960,2708.520,"It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own."
f000201,2708.520,2716.880,"The hero of the wonderful novel that had so In fluenced his life had himself known this curious fancy."
f000202,2716.880,2793.040,"In the seventh chapter he tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him, and the fluteplayer mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had caroused with the greenshirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an Ivory manger with a jewelfrontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible tsediam vilse, that comes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at tlie red shambles of the Circus, and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silvershod mules, been carried through the Street of Pome granates to a House of Gold, and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage, and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun."
f000203,2793.040,2981.440,"Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or cunninglywrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom Vice and Blood and Weariness had made monstrous or mad : Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife, and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men, and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him, and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent, and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta, and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shame ful passion built a pagan church for Christian wor ship; Charles VI., who had so wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of Love and Death and Madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow piazza, of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him."
f000204,2981.440,2986.600,"There was a horrible fascination in them all."

f000206,2991.320,3005.200,"The Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain."
